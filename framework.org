#+title: Framework for System Implementation in Elm

Follow the given template to implement transition systems in elm.

For each transition system do the following.

* Define Model Type

  A =Model= is the set of states in the system.  This corresponds
  to $X$ in the /sextuple/ $(X, X_{0}, U, \rightarrow, Y, H)$ that
  defines a system.

* Initialize the Model
  
  After defining the set of states in the Model type, you need to give
  an initial state to the model.

  If you define =init= as an initialization of the model then $init
  \in X_{0}$.

  
  
* Define Message Type

* Implement Update Function

* Implement transition functions

* Implement View Functions
